This file explains how to setup a motmot server on your box.

Dependenecies:

gevent - http://www.gevent.org
pyopenssl - https://launchpad.net/pyopenssl
msgpack - http://www.msgpack.org

All of these can be installed using easy_install

installation:

./install.sh

This script will setup necessary directories and create the sqlite file that will hold users and friends. Does not install dependencies.

Add users:

`sqlite3 config.db INSERT INTO users(userName, password) VALUES ('username goes here','password goes here');`

To start the server:

./server.py "URL GOES HERE"

EX. ./server.py "motmot.com"

-----How to do single server testing-----

Setup:

run: ./install_test.sh

This script will add the test users to your config.db. DELETE THESE USERS BEFORE PRODUCTION USE

How to use the testing script:

./testClient.py [test type] [pass or fail] [server url]

Acceptable values for [test type]:
'auth' -- Tests authentication
'friend' -- Tests requesting a friend
'unfriend' -- Tests unfriending a user
'accept' -- Tests accepting a friend request
'listener' -- Creates a second user that will listen for push updates
'getAllStat' -- Tests getting all statuses for friends
'getStatus' -- Tests getting the status for a specific user
'cert' -- Tests signing a client certificate
'ms_send' -- Tests all functions using two servers. See next section for explanation
'ms_listen' -- Listener for multi-server testing

Acceptable values for [pass or fail]
True -- This test should succeed
False -- This test should fail

[server url] is the url of the server you wish to connect to and test. Install script uses bensing.com as the testing domain. You will need to create an entry in /etc/hosts to point the url to your motmot installation

-----How to do multi-server testing-----

You will need to create /etc/hosts entries for bensing1.com and bensing2.com that point to appropriate installations.

on installation 1:

./server.py "bensing2.com"
./testClient "ms_listen" [pass or fail] "bensing2.com"

on installation 2:

./server.py "bensing1.com"
./testClient "ms_send" [pass or fail] "bensing1.com"
